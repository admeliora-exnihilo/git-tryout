What text shall I put here?

## Let's try a subheading.

### With smaller...

_Now_ let's start putting in text! 

### more specific...

I like markdowns because they allow us to format our words in various, brilliant ways. Emphasis through italics, bold, or underline are especially useful for understanding one's words fully. Proper (or improper) emphasis can change the entire meaning of a sentence!

### sub-sub headings?

For example, surely you remember this?

> I never said *we* should kill him.
> I never said we should *kill* him.
> I never said we should kill *him*.

And all the other variants :)
